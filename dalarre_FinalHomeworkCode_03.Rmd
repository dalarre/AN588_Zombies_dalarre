## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## This returns the mean of each quantitative variable in d
mean(d$height)
mean(d$weight)
mean(d$zombies_killed)
mean(d$years_of_education)
mean(d$age)


## This creates a function that calculates the population standard deviation
pop_sd <- function(x) {
    sqrt(sum((x - mean(x))^2)/(length(x)))
}
## This returns the population standard deviation of each quantitative variable in d
pop_sd(d$height)
pop_sd(d$weight)
pop_sd(d$zombies_killed)
pop_sd(d$years_of_education)
pop_sd(d$age)

ageboxplot <- ggplot(d, aes(gender, age, color = factor(gender))) + geom_boxplot(show.legend = F) + xlab("Gender") + ylab("Age")

## This code creates the boxplots of each quantitative variable by gender. The show.legend = F argument deletes the legend.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

height_age <- ggplot(d, aes(age, height)) + geom_point(color = "darkgreen") + xlab("Age") + ylab("Height") + geom_smooth(method = lm) 
height_age

weight_age <- ggplot(d, aes(age, weight)) + geom_point(color = "darkblue") + xlab("Age") + ylab("Weight") 
weight_age + geom_smooth(method = lm)

## This code creates scatterplots of height and weight in relation to age. 
## Height seems to be related to age (directly proportional). Weight values are more scattered and it is difficult to assume a relation
## After peer commentary I added the regression lines 
```

```{r}
## This code creates Q-Q plots of the quantitative variables to check if they are drawn for a normal distribution

qqnorm(d$height, main = "Height Q-Q plot")
qqline(d$height, col = "blue")

qqnorm(d$weight, main = "Weight Q-Q plot")
qqline(d$weight, col = "blue")

qqnorm(d$zombies_killed, main = "Zombies killed Q-Q plot")
qqline(d$zombies_killed, col = "blue")

qqnorm(d$years_of_education, main = "Years of education Q-Q plot")
qqline(d$years_of_education, col = "blue")

qqnorm(d$age, main = "Age Q-Q plot")
qqline(d$age, col = "blue")

## The resultant Q-Q plots indicate that height, weight and age are variables drawn from the normal distribution. Zombies_killed and Years_of_education are discrete variables, so they can't be normally distributed. They are probably drawn from the poisson distribution. To check this we can plot a histogram of the data and compare it to a histogram of simulated data from a poisson distribution with a mean of 3 (approximately equal to the means of zombies_killed and years_of_education) to see if the approximate shape of the distribution is the same

hist(d$zombies_killed)

hist(d$years_of_education)

hist(rpois(100000,3))

## Comparing the histograms we can see that they have really similar shapes, so it is very probable that the data follow the Poisson distribution. However, we haven`t proved it totally.

```{r}
## This samples a subset of 30 people
set.seed(1)
s <- sample(1:nrow(d), 30, replace = F)
d[s,]

## This calculates the mean of each variable in the sample
m_height <- mean(d$height[s])
m_height
m_weight <- mean(d$weight[s])
m_weight
m_zk <- mean(d$zombies_killed[s])
m_zk
m_yoe <- mean(d$years_of_education[s])
m_yoe
m_age <- mean(d$age[s])
m_age

## This calculates the standard deviation of each variable in the sample
sd(d$height[s])
sd(d$weight[s])
sd(d$zombies_killed[s])
sd(d$years_of_education[s])
sd(d$age[s])


## This builds a function for calculating the standard error
se <- function(x) {
    sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))
}

##  This calculates the estandard error of each variable in the sample
se_height <- se(d$height[s])
se_height
se_weight <- se(d$weight[s])
se_weight
se_zk <- se(d$zombies_killed[s])
se_zk
se_yoe <- se(d$years_of_education[s])
se_yoe
se_age <- se(d$age[s])
se_age


##This calculates the 95% confidence intervals of the variables that are normally distributed
## After peer commentary I realized that I had to use the t distribution for the CIs because the sample size is 30

lower_h <- m_height - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_height
upper_h <- m_height + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_height
ci_h <- c(lower_h, upper_h)
ci_h


lower_w <- m_weight - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_weight
upper_w <- m_weight + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_weight
ci_w <- c(lower_w, upper_w)
ci_w


lower_age <- m_age - qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_age
upper_age <- m_age + qt(1 - 0.05/2, df = 30 - 1) * se_age
ci_age <- c(lower_age, upper_age)
ci_age



## During peer commentary we figured out this way to do the CIs for poisson. 
## This calculates the 95% confidence interval for the variables that follow the poisson distribution
## Using qpois(p, lambda)
## For lambda I used the mean calculated in question 1 (the population mean)

lower_zk <- m_zk - qpois(1 - 0.05/2, 2.992) * se_zk
upper_zk <- m_zk + qpois(1 - 0.05/2, 2.992) * se_zk
ci_zk <- c(lower_zk, upper_zk)
ci_zk


lower_yoe <- m_yoe - qpois(1 - 0.05/2, 2.996) * se_yoe
upper_yoe <- m_yoe + qpois(1 - 0.05/2, 2.996) * se_yoe
ci_yoe <- c(lower_yoe, upper_yoe)
ci_yoe

## This plots the sampling distributions
hist(meanhsamp)
hist(meanwsamp)
hist(meanzksamp)

## To see if they are normally distributed, I do Q-Q plots

qqnorm(meanhsamp, main = "Mean Height Q-Q plot")
qqline(meanhsamp, col = "blue")

qqnorm(meanwsamp, main = "Mean Weight Q-Q plot")
qqline(meanwsamp, col = "blue")

qqline(meanzksamp, col = "blue")

qqnorm(meanyoesamp, main = "Mean Years of education Q-Q plot")
qqline(meanyoesamp, col = "blue")

qqnorm(meanasamp, main = "Mean Age Q-Q plot")
qqline(meanasamp, col = "blue")

## Following the Central Limit Theorem, all of this sampling distributions are normally distributed, even the ones that weren't originally drawn from a normal distribution
